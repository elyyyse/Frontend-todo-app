## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- VanillaJS

### What I learned

- This was my first project using the [content template element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/template) `<template>`
- Learned some best practices for when to use `<img>` tags in my HTML versus when to set `background: url()` in my CSS
- Figured out how to create a gradient border with border radius (possibly juice not worth the squeeze)

### Continued development

- For v1 of this app, I did not finesse the transitions for creating/deleting todos or any of the hover states. I may take a pass at that in v2.
- There was a bonus requirement in this challenge to add drag and drop. This is something I might revisit once I've learned React or a similar framework.
